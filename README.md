# Sales-Prediction-Regressor

ML pipeline for sales prediction through Random forest regressor:

As a first step,prototype machine learning model was build and most significant predictor variables selected by model based feature selection technique.Using those most important features, best Random Forest regressor was created.To automate the prediction process for new data set,best model has been integrated to sklearn ML pipeline.Then it is possible to skip data pre-processing steps for new data set and it will do automatically by ML pipeline.
